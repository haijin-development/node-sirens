# FingerTips

A library to define, run and follow the flow of an application.

### FingerTips architecture and design decisions

The implementation of FingerTips may seem unnecessary complex.

The intention of FingerTips is to move the complexity of the solution of its domain problem from
its use to its implementation, hiding the complexity from its users, and to provide a simple, clear
and unified interface of use.

[This article](../../docs/FingerTips.pdf) details some of the implementation decisions taken during the design of FingerTips.


### Why the name?

FingerTips aims to express the flow of an application at a single glance and to follow it like the routes of a beautiful map with the gentle and subtle touch of the finger tips.
